# Vanilla JS examples
The best way to learn a new programming language is to build projects.
I have created a list of beginner friendly project tutorials in Vanilla JavaScript.
My advice for this repository would be to examine projects and rebuild it your own way. Experiment with adding new features or using different methods.
That will test if you have really learned the concepts or not.
My new projects will be with React.js 🐱‍💻
